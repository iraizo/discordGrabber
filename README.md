# discordGrabber
Grabs user information like username userid token email etc. 

### Requirements:
- [lohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

### Tested on:
- Release
- PTB 
- Canary
### Update:
- 8 Hours after release discord is already trying to fight it by.. not having the explorer parent anymore?
  Fixed it by just checking if the wstring of the parent is empty.
